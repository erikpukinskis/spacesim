Untitled Spaceship Builder will hopefully eventually be a game where you can build and fly space ships.

But that will be a long time from now. In the near future, you will be able fabricate some very rudimentary spaceship _parts_.

And at the present moment, all you can do is see a nice star:

## How to "play"

Note: there's nothing to actually play yet.

### Installing Rust

Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your path.

### Install OS dependencies
